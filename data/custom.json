      "description": "\"Christmas festivities left us with a ton of panettone and in need of some new ways to eat it. My grandpa requested French toast, so here is a new holiday twist on a delicious breakfast classic. Feel free to cut your panettone smaller before cooking if it is hard to manipulate. Serve warm with maple syrup, whipped cream, or any other topping.\"",
